She was heavily identified with Selene, the Moon, and Hecate, another Moon goddess, and was thus regarded as one of the most prominent lunar deities in mythology, alongside the aforementioned two. She would often roam the forests of Greece, attended by her large entourage, mostly made up of nymphs, some mortals, and hunters.",

She wears anklets with bells, and though seldom seen, she can be heard by the tinkling of her anklets. She is also described as a dancer.",
